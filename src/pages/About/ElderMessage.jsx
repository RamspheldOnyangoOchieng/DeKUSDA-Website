            <p>
              Welcome to DeKUSDA, the Seventh-day Adventist Church at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.
              I warmly welcome you to this sacred space — a home far away from home, where faith meets intellect,
              and divine purpose shapes destinies.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a world that is constantly changing, filled with empty pursuits, and ever-widening voids; in such a world that needs
              light, hope, and direction, DeKUSDA Church stands as a beacon of hope and spiritual anchorage. Within the dynamic and
              often challenging university environment, our church strives — in the most diverse and intentional ways — to meet the
              deepest spiritual, emotional, and moral needs of students and members.
            </p>

            <p>
              Guided by our vision: <span className="font-bold text-blue-800">"To empower the Seventh-day Adventist students, professionals, the Church, and to heal the nation"</span>,
              we are committed to fostering a mission-focused culture through public campus ministries, personal ministry, and
              evangelistic outreach.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span className="italic text-gray-600">
                "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend." — Proverbs 27:17
              </span><br />
              We place a strong emphasis on mentorship among members — where the spiritually mature walk alongside the young in faith —
              and on the upbringing of leaders who are rooted in Christ and equipped to serve.
            </p>

            <p>
              A church that fails to engage in mission and evangelism risks losing its heart and identity. Thus, as a church, we are
              unequivocally committed to the Great Commission Christ entrusted to us in
              <span className="font-semibold text-blue-700"> Matthew 28:18–20</span>, where He declares,
              <span className="italic text-gray-600"> “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go ye therefore and make disciples…”</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              As a church, we move forward not by our own strength, but with unwavering confidence in the One who called us.
              Christ’s words echo time and again and anchor our ministry:
              <span className="italic text-gray-600"> “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world”</span> (Matthew 28:20).
              Through every season, every challenge, and every opportunity, God has been faithful — and we trust fully in His continued leading.
            </p>
