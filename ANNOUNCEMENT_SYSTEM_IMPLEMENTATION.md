# Dynamic Announcement System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a dynamic announcement system that allows the "Communication Sabbath" section and other announcements to be managed from the admin panel instead of being hardcoded in the homepage.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Components

#### Updated Announcement Model (`/backend/app/Models/Announcement.php`)
- Added fillable fields: `event_time`, `event_location`, `is_featured`, `is_active`
- Added scopes for filtering: `active()`, `featured()`, `category()`, `priority()`
- Added proper relationships and casting

#### Updated AnnouncementController (`/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/AnnouncementController.php`)
- Implemented full CRUD operations
- Added filtering capabilities (active, featured, category, priority)
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Support for public and admin endpoints

#### Database Migration
- Created migration to add homepage-specific fields to announcements table
- Fields added: `category`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `is_active`, `is_featured`, `contact_info`, `action_required`, `action_deadline`, `image_url`, `event_time`, `event_location`

#### Announcement Seeder
- Created sample announcements including the Communication Sabbath
- Provides fallback data for testing

### 2. Frontend Components

#### New AnnouncementBanner Component (`/frontend/src/components/sections/AnnouncementBanner.jsx`)
- Dynamically fetches featured announcements from API
- Falls back to default content if no announcements found
- Responsive design matching the original styling
- Displays event time and location
- Shows category badges and action buttons
- Loading states and error handling

#### Updated Homepage (`/frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`)
- Replaced hardcoded announcement section with dynamic AnnouncementBanner component
- Removed unused imports
- Maintains the same visual appearance

#### Announcements Service (`/frontend/src/services/announcements.js`)
- Complete API service for announcement management
- Methods for public viewing and admin management
- Error handling and response processing

#### Updated AnnouncementsManagement Component
- Added `event_time` and `event_location` fields to the form
- Integrated with the announcements service
- Updated form validation and data handling
- Enhanced with proper API integration

## How It Works

### For Admin Users:
1. Go to Admin Panel → Announcements Management
2. Create/Edit announcements with these key fields:
   - **Title**: Main announcement heading (e.g., "Communication Sabbath")
   - **Content**: Description text (e.g., "Join us for a special time...")
   - **Event Time**: Time of the event (e.g., "7:50 AM")
   - **Event Location**: Location of the event (e.g., "Food Science Workshop")
   - **Is Featured**: Toggle to show on homepage
   - **Is Active**: Toggle to enable/disable
   - **Category**: Type of announcement (worship, youth, health, etc.)
   - **Priority**: Importance level

### For Website Visitors:
1. Homepage automatically displays the most recent featured announcement
2. If no announcement is active, shows default Communication Sabbath content
3. Real-time updates when admins change announcements

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints:
- `GET /api/announcements` - Get all announcements
- `GET /api/announcements?featured=true&active=true` - Get featured announcements
- `GET /api/announcements/{id}` - Get specific announcement

### Admin Endpoints:
- `GET /admin/announcements` - Get all announcements for management
- `POST /admin/announcements` - Create new announcement
- `PUT /admin/announcements/{id}` - Update announcement
- `DELETE /admin/announcements/{id}` - Delete announcement

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Content Management**: No more hardcoded announcements
2. **Easy Updates**: Admin can change homepage content without developer intervention
3. **Scheduling**: Set start and end dates for announcements
4. **Multiple Announcements**: Support for various types of church announcements
5. **Professional UI**: Maintains the beautiful original design
6. **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes
7. **Fallback Support**: Shows default content if API fails

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:
1. Run the backend server: `php artisan serve`
2. Access admin panel and create your first announcement
3. Set `is_featured: true` to display on homepage
4. Test the functionality

## Usage Example

1. Login to admin panel
2. Go to Announcements Management
3. Either edit existing "Communication Sabbath" or create new
4. Fill in:
   - Title: "Youth Sabbath"

   - Event Time: "10:00 AM"
   - Event Location: "Main Sanctuary"
   - Is Featured: ✓ (checked)
   - Is Active: ✓ (checked)
5. Save - homepage will automatically update!

The system is now fully functional and ready for use!
